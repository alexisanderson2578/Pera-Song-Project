Since this is my first project with CSS, javascript,and html there was a big learning curve for me these past two weeks and I have learned a lot since then! Index.html, style.css and song.js all run together using a local server. I personally used Live Server, an extension on visual studio code to run the html. 

One component of the project that was somewhat ambiguous to me was whether this live server was giving the necessary ajax requests and responses needed to give JSON as the dataformat. I was having issues JSON.parsing the data. For this reason I made a second file called mockedsong.js with hard coded AJAX requests and responses as a secondary submission in case I was missing something in song.js. For this file I just ran it in the terminal using node.js and any necessary testing.
